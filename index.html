                Hello. I won't share my real name, of course, but my username online is lacelit684 or a variation.<br>
                I was born in Thailand and am currently in school.

            <p>
                I am quite fine doing Lua, Luau (I made and scripted games on roblox) and Python. Also I have theoretic knowledge of RegEx.<br>
                I am also OK with front-end such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
